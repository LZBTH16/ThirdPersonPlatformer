The following video is a demonstration of the third person platformer.

The features include:
- Third person free-look camera
- WASD movement control, with the camera dictating the forward direction of the movement
- Double jump

Additionally, adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle was maintained, with logic grouped appropriately in well-named scripts to ensure a consistent coding style.
